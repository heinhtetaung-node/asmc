Database field changes
1. In forms talble new field edit_permission default 0. tiny int 0,1 add 0 is not allow and 1 is allow



Logic of after 3 days, only admin can enable the form to be edited by them again
- add new field edit_permission (0 is not allow,1 allow)
- is In 3 days, admin cannot see the Edit permission enable button
- is In 3 days director, manager can edit even edit_permission = 0

- more than 3 days, admin can see the edit permission enable button and they can control
- more than 3 days, director, manager can edit when edit_permission = 1
